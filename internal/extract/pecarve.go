// Base64-PE carving. A dropper hides a Windows PE inside a document by
// base64-encoding it into a text field (e.g. an OOXML docProps <dc:description>),
// commonly with a leading pad ("AAAA…") so that the MZ DOS header lands at a
// NON-ZERO offset of the decoded blob. The static decode pass (fromEncoded)
// decodes the base64/hex run and emits the bytes as a stream, but YARA's `pe`
// module anchors on an MZ header at offset 0, so a pad-prefixed decoded blob never
// satisfies a pe rule and the embedded executable goes entirely unscored.
//
// carveEmbeddedPEs rescans the streams the decode pass just produced for a
// STRUCTURALLY VALID PE (an MZ DOS header whose e_lfanew reaches "PE\0\0", via
// isValidPEAt) that starts past offset 0, and appends the MZ-aligned slice as a
// new stream so the pe rules see a real header at offset 0. It also emits a single
// BASE64-PE-CARVE marker so the realignment itself is scored — a full PE smuggled
// base64 inside a document body has no benign analogue.
//
// FP-safety: isValidPEAt validates THROUGH e_lfanew, so an incidental "MZ" pair in
// decoded text cannot trip it; and the carve runs ONLY over the decode-pass output
// (already-decoded payload bytes), never over raw document body. A blob already
// MZ-aligned at offset 0 is skipped (the pe module already sees it).
